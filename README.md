This is Entry Tasks for ITransition Academy.

You can see tasks themselfs in a .docx file in a root.

My comments about tasks:

TASK 1:

All sql queries were written in T-SQL dialect and checked in ssms 18.

I create 2 directories for sql queries (see var1 & var2 dirs). 
In var1 queries are simpler, but we need to assume that there only 1 department with max salary or whatever (only queries 2 & 3).
In var2 directory I have fixed this bug, but queries became a bit larger (only queries 2 & 3).

TASK 2:

There is JSON file in a root of the project, u need to insert full path to the input and output files(even if output file don't exist)

That's all!
